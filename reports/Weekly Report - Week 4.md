# Weekly Report 

Week 4

## Team Report

### Plans from Last Week
[N/A]

### Progress and Issues
**Project progress: **
* We identified the major features that we should focus on
* We constructed 6 use cases
* The team also extensively discussed how we are going to organize communication between the front-end and the back-end this week. We concluded it was important to have a server in the middle and not allow direct database access in the app.


**Technical achievement:**
* We set up the basic structure of the application on Android Studio
* We set up the github for version control

**Collaboration:**
* We divided our roles on this project.
* We decided to set up an extra meeting on every Saturday afternoon
* We worked well with each other and reached a general consensus of what our projects should do, the tools and programming languages we want to use and other general issues

**Issues:**
* We can’t guarantee that the API will work for our project. If not, it can be a huge risk.  

### Plans for Next Week
[ ] Data modelling and database design. The goal is to draw an ER diagram showing the entities, relations, cardinalities, presumptions and other issues related to database management. 
[ ] Software architecture: we will use MVC structure for our project. We need to specify the major functions and components of each part in MVC, and the interfaces between them

## Contributions of individual team members
**Brian**
* Wrote the use case for reporting incorrect or inappropriate content.
* Helped write out requirements of the project and finalized the product description, and discussed realistic goals and stretch goals
* Outlined how we can control communication between the modular frontend and backend portions of code through calls to the server, but further database design will wait until we have a better idea of the app layout and front end specifics.
* As we begin talking  about architecture and design throughout the next week, Huan and I will finalize the database(s) specifics with a concrete ER diagram and begin looking for and testing different database solutions.

**Daniel**
* Wrote 2 use cases
* Helped write the product description
* Wrote the schedule for front end and edited back end schedule
* Various other edits

**Huan**
* Set up the project proposal as a foundation for team discussion
* Raised one user case, and help modify other user cases
* Analyzed and wrote the risk part of requirement document
* Prepare zoom meetings and other trivas

**Jacky**
* I worked on the requirements assignment, specifically on writing 1 or so use cases and parts of the process description. I learned a little bit on starting to use android studio to develop our app, and ran into some issues setting it up
* I plan to work with my team on creating our software architecture, such as the design of our database. I also plan to working on the basic mockup of the app’s user interface. 

**Kouroche**
* I worked on Use Case 5 thinking about the Activity Feed.
* I looked at the different APIs that can provide plant recognition for us (plant.id, Pl@ntNet), and helped the team figure out which goals were short-term and long-term for the project planning.
* I worked on the document formatting, getting the use cases neatly organized.
* I created the Android Studio project for the front-end and pushed it to the Git repo, we decided to go with a tabbed layout.
